            <p>I'm Hafida P. Guro, a Grade-12 student at MSU-Marawi Senior High School. I'm currently living in Mipantao Gadongan, Marawi City, LDS. My dream is to become a doctor.
                Helping people and making a positive impact through medicine is what I'm passionate about. Even with my busy schedule, I find joy in hobbies like reading, singing, dancing, eating, and sleeping.
                As the middle child among five siblings, I see my ambition as a chance to set an example for my family, showing them the importance of determination and compassion.
                My goal is to dedicate myself to helping others and making a meaningful difference in the world.</p>
                
            <h2>LIKES</h2>
            <p>I find joy in simple things like sleeping and savoring diverse cuisines. Korean dramas, singing, and dancing are my go-to forms of expression. 
            Exploring new places allows me to freeze beautiful moments through my lens. Moreover, I love hanging out with people who vibe with me. 
            Being around those who share my energy and interests adds an extra layer of fun to my experiences, filling them with laughter and a sense of belonging.</p>
            
            <h2>DISLIKES</h2>
	    	<p>I prefer to spend time with people who share similar values and vibes as me. I tend to avoid those who are judgmental or disrespectful toward others.
		    Heights make me feel uncomfortable; I'm not a fan of being in high places. Also, although I dislike being shy, but I'm working on overcoming it to express myself more freely and connect better with others.

            <h2>MY SCHOOL</h2>
